# My-First-React-App

This project was created from the React + Vite template and provides a minimal setup to get React working with Vite (including HMR) and a basic ESLint setup.

Included notes:

- **React + Vite**: Minimal template for React apps using Vite as the dev server and build tool.
- **Plugin options**: You can use `@vitejs/plugin-react` (Babel-based) or `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` (SWC-based) for fast refresh and JSX transforms.
- **React Compiler**: The React Compiler is not enabled by default due to performance tradeoffs. See React docs if you want to enable it.
- **TypeScript**: For production apps we recommend TypeScript and type-aware ESLint rules. See the Vite React TS template for setup guidance.

For more info about running and developing this app, see the project files and `package.json` scripts.
